This project is mainly based on payment gateway system. This is my 6th Semester minor project. In this, I used different programming languages, frameworks and libraries in which for FRONTEND, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5 and for BackEnd I used NodeJS, ExpressJS & many more packages. At last, for Database, I used MongoDB in which I install mongoose and connect it to both local database and  global database i.e. MongoDB Atlas. Through all this, I get payment gateway system as well as login and signup form which will validate the users and protect us from fraud transaction through the access of registerd usere in database.
